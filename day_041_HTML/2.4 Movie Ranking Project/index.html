<h1>The Best Movies According to Philip</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>
  I know it's a trillogy, but given that Tolkien wrote it as a single novel, and
  Jackson filmed it all at once, it seems fitting to count it as a single entry.
</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  This movie hit so hard as a child, and I've kept finding myself watching it
  every few years and each time I find more to enjoy.

<h3>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</h3>
<p>Because honor is second only to loyalty.</p>
