## OOP

Procedural programing is when function leads to next function.

OOP allows you to isolate functions by making it modular

### Object
waiter
attributes - variables that are associated with that object.
methods - are the functions that object can perform.

Can generate multiple objects that are similar from a Class.


### Class
car = CarBlueprint()

```python
import turtle

import another_module

print(another_module.another_variable)

timmy = turtle.Turtle()
#One option to tap into a libary.
```
