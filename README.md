## Journal

### Day 001 Band Name Generator

This was a simple introduction to `print`, `input`, and variables. I learned I could nest inputs directly into a desired print function which was neat, and I look forward to expanding upon my CS50P course.

### Day 002 Tip Calculator

When Subscripting you can use negative numbers to index a string backwards.

### Day 003 Treasure Island

Easy enough. Looking forward to days 16+ after the downloaded material *which I skipped*. Not a fan of forced IDE and interface downloads.
