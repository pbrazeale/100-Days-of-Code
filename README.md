### Day 001 Band Name Generator
A CLI that concatenates your birth city and pet's name to print your band name.

This was a simple introduction to `print`, `input`, and variables. I learned I could nest inputs directly into a desired print function which was neat, and I look forward to expanding upon my CS50P course.

### Day 002 Tip Calculator
A CLI that takes in the bill total, desired tip percent, and party members to divide amongst, and prints the individual bill amount.

When Subscripting you can use negative numbers to index a string backwards.

### Day 003 Treasure Island
A CLI game that mimics the '80s RPGs.

Easy enough. Looking forward to days 16+ after the downloaded material *which I skipped*. Not a fan of forced IDE and interface downloads.

### Day 004 Rock, Paper, Scissors
A CLI game for RPS.

Super easy. Coded it up with zero errors. Learned about `random.choice` which will indeed come in handy in the future.

### Day 005 Password Generator
A CLI for generating passwords.

I took the lesson and expanded upon it. My generator now requires a band of 12 to 20 characters, and then randomly generates the characters using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.  

### Day 006 Maze
Solved this problem, [reeborg.ca](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) using basic python functions to navigate maze using the follow right path method.

Easy, but I didn't consider the edge case of the square void starting position;
however the solution was easy enough [GitHub code](https://github.com/pbrazeale/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/Day_006_Maze/maze.py)
